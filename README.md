# Inverse Pendulum - Deep Reinforcement Learning
in this code and article, I will compare different methods of deep reinforcement learning in the CartPole environment. At first, I will go through the basic equations and background. Then we will explain the method we used -a random one as a baseline for this project, deep Q-Learning, deep Q-Learning with memory replay, and double Deep Q-Learning. I will compare each method and we will see which one gives the best performance.
